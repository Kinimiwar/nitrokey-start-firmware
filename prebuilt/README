Here are stored firmwares used to flash devices in first (RTM.1, GNUK v1.0.4)
and second (RTM.2, v1.2.2) series.  Both HEX and BIN files are usable for
direct flashing (HEX files have checksum control). Only BIN files however could
be used for regnual upgrade.  Since LEDs are swapped in RTM.2 using it with
regnual upgrade will result in not working LED. For this please use files from
RTM.1_to_RTM.2_upgrade/ directory.  Please unpack .hex.gz files before using or
they might be interpreted as binary by flashing software.

Binary version for RTM.1 is provided only for testing purposes and it is a
result of the following command:
srec_cat nitrokey-start-firmware-1.0.4-1a.hex -intel -offset -0x08000000 -o nitrokey-start-firmware-1.0.4-1a.bin -binary
Please use .hex file for flashing.

Output of sha512sum utility is located in checksums.sha512 file.
